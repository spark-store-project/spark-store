#### Differences Between arm64 and amd64

arm64

* Full Name: Advanced RISC Machine 64-bit
* Main Use: Primarily used in mobile devices, embedded systems, and some new servers and desktop computers.
* Advantages: Low power consumption, high efficiency, suitable for battery-driven and heat-sensitive devices.
* Main Manufacturers: Apple, Qualcomm, HiSilicon, Phytium, etc.

amd64

* Full Name: AMD 64-bit, also known as x86_64
* Main Use: Primarily used in desktop computers, laptops, and servers.
* Advantages: High performance, suitable for computation-intensive applications.
* Main Manufacturers: Intel and AMD.
* The main differences between the two are in the instruction sets and application scenarios. amd64 is usually used for high-performance computers and servers, while arm64 is more commonly used in power-sensitive settings.

#### How to Check:

Linux:

- Open the terminal.
- Type `uname -m` or `arch` and press Enter.

### Domestic Architecture Support
**Q: I use a domestic chip architecture, how can I get applications?**  
**A:** Currently, Spark Store supports **arm** architecture for domestic chips. You can download deb packages suitable for arm64 architecture.

### Dependency Issues
**Q: I get errors when installing dependencies**  
**A:** If you are using UOS or deepin, please do not install the dependency packages. For Kali Linux/Kdeneon etc., temporary support is not available, please compile and install yourself.  
> üí° If errors occur, try running `sudo apt update` before attempting the installation again. If the issue persists, refer to the first question and seek help on the community platform.

### Submission and App Updates
**Q: Where can I submit applications?**  
**A:** You can find the "Submit Application" option in the upper-right corner menu of the app store interface.

### Support for Non-deepin/UOS Users
**Q: I'm not a deepin/UOS user; can I use the Spark App Store?**  
**A:** Yes, you can directly install if you're using Ubuntu 22.04. For Ubuntu 20.04/Debian10/Debian11, please install the dependencies first.

---

### Installation Methods
**Q: Can I use dpkg -i for installation?**  
**A:** No! Use `sudo apt install ./xxxx.deb` to install, or use graphical installers like gdebi.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Using dpkg directly will not handle software dependencies, which is a common mistake.

---

### System Updates
**Q: Will the Spark Store affect normal system updates?**  
**A:** No, the Spark Store has separated its application sources from system sources and will not affect regular system updates.
