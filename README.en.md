# Spark App Store

The `Spark App Store` is now designed for Linux!


</div>

---

As we all know, there are few Linux applications in our country, wine applications are hard to get, high-quality tools are scattered in various folk forums, unable to form synergy, difficult to improve the ecology
Ecological construction does not need one party to fight alone, but everyone to act, gather sparks, resulting in a prairie fire

We created this app store, which includes a wide range of software packages we need, a collection of quality widgets, an active adaptation of wine apps, and a repository for everyone to access

We support: Deepin 20; Ubuntu 20.04LTS; UOS Home 20

Weâ€™d love to see some of you join us as well, and weâ€™d love to help build the Linux application ecosystem
